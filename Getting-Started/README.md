# 01: Getting Started 🚀
This folder contains my introductory designs from HDLBits. I am documenting the hardware logic "Bit by Bit."
Click on each problem below to see the details and real-world applications.

<details>
<summary><b>🔹 Problem: Step One</b></summary>

*   **Code:** [Step_One.v](./Step_One.v)
*   **Key Logic:** Continuous Assignment (`assign`)
1. Every piece of hardware starts with 'module' and ends 
   with 'endmodule'.
2. Here,the 'output one' defines a pin that sends a signal out of the chip.
3. Also the 'assign' keyword creates a continuous hardware connection and it's like a physical connection.
* **Real-Life App:** A "Power-On" LED indicator. Once the circuit has power, the output 
is 'assigned' to High (1) to keep the LED glowing constantly.

<summary><b>🔹 Problem: Zero</b></summary>

*   **Code:** [zero.v](./zero.v)
*   **Key Logic:** Logical Low / Grounding
*   **Real-Life App:** Grounding unused pins to prevent electrical noise in 2026 circuits.
